## Recognitions

[Sol challenge](https://github.com/massun-onibakuchi/sol-challenge) is a collection of CTF challenges made by [massun-onibakuchi](https://github.com/massun-onibakuchi).

## What's inside this repository?

I have refactored all the `tests` to use [foundry.](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html)
Inside each `test` file you will find a working solution for each challenge with a brief explanation about it.

I'll create a blog post about a full explanation for each challenge in the upcoming weeks.

## Getting Started

**Note:** `npm run test` will perform tests that can be run locally and with a forked version of main net. Before running it, please update the `FORK_RPC_URL` placeholder you find in `package.json`

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```

## Development

This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). See the [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) for instructions on how to install and use Foundry.
